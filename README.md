# Suricata from to MISP

the purpose of the application is to import attributes from MISP into suricata datasets to put them under surveillance. If an alert is generated by suricata via one of these attributes, a sigthings will be added in MISP on this attribute.

## Concepts of datasets in Suricata

Indicators can be saved in a suricata dataset and create detection rules on this dataset.
